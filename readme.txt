= What are the Terms of Service? =
Please see the complete [Terms of Service](https://webspellchecker.com/legal/terms-of-service/) for the plugin here.

= Is my text secure? What is your Privacy Policy? =
We have an extensive Privacy Policy in place to protect your texts. Please see the details [here](https://webspellchecker.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

= What browsers are supported? =
The plugin supports latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and MS Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

= Can I suggest a feature? =
Sure, please let us know how we can make the plugin more useful for you. Create a new topic under the support section of this plugin.

= How can I uninstall the plugin? =
To uninstall the plugin, you need to be a website administrator. Please login to the website admin area and go to Plugins. Locate WProofreader on the list of the plugins and click Deactivate below the plugin title. The last step is to simply click Delete that appears after the deactivation.

= My website exceeded word usage quota. What does it mean? =
Both the Free and Pro versions of the plugin have usage limitations. One of them is the aggregated number of words checked during a certain period.

The Free version is limited to 10,000 words for a single website aggregated for all users per day. Once the aggregated usage for a website exceeds this number, the plugin stops checking text until the next day (00:00 UTC-0) and the next error message will be shown on the plugin's settings page: “Word usage quota for the free plan exceeded. Contact support for more details.“

Below is the example explaining how the usage is calculated. The plugin doesn't run in a background or doesn't generate false data usage. If the plugin is enabled, it works only when a page or blog post is in the **editing** mode.

Let's assume you have a page which contains 1000 words. You open it for editing and this is when the plugin starts. All the text from this page will be sent for checking. Thus, 1000 words are checked and recorded as usage. You still continue editing, let's say you decided to make some changes in the 2nd paragraph which contains 100 words. Since there were some changes, the plugin needs to recheck this part. As a result extra 100 words will be sent for checking. We can't send individual words as checking relies on sentences. So, now 1100 words are recorded in usage. Later you decide that you want to save the page as a draft and preview changes. After previewing changes, you decide to go back to editing and open the page for editing again (again this is when the plugin starts). The plugin doesn't know that this is the same page and does rechecking again. As a result plus 1000 words are added to the general statistics. The total is now 2100 words. Also, let's imagine that while editing mode is ON you have to reload a page a few times, the whole page will be rechecked after each reload of the page or browser.
